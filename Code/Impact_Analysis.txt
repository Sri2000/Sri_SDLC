1. Change Request: Modify get_user_order_history for Pagination and Filtering
Description of Change:

We need to extend the get_user_order_history function to:

Support pagination (fetch only a subset of orders per request).
Add filtering capabilities, including filtering by order status and date range.
Impact:
s

Pagination: The function now handles pagination, ensuring that large datasets (e.g., users with many orders) can be retrieved in chunks, improving performance and user experience.
Filtering: Users can now filter their order history based on status (e.g., "shipped", "processing") and a date range. This will make the system more flexible, allowing users to query for specific orders.
Database/Backend Load: Adding filtering and pagination means that queries to the backend database (or whatever data store is being used) need to be optimized to handle these parameters efficiently.
Edge Cases: If the user has no orders or if no orders match the filtering criteria, the function will return a message indicating this.
Steps to Implement:

Add status, start_date, and end_date as optional parameters to the function.
Implement logic to filter orders based on these parameters.
Implement pagination logic to limit the number of orders fetched per request.
Example of Behavior:

If a user has multiple orders, the first request may return orders 1–10. A second request can return orders 11–20 (using pagination).
If a user asks for orders from December 2024 with the status "shipped", the function will return only the relevant orders.
2. Change Request: Modify process_payment to Support Multiple Payment Methods and Retry Logic
Description of Change:
We need to extend the process_payment function to:

Support multiple payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal).
Introduce retry logic to handle intermittent failures when interacting with the external payment gateway.
Provide more detailed feedback if the payment fails (e.g., reason for failure, specific error codes).
Impact:

Multiple Payment Methods: The function now supports both credit card and PayPal payment methods, making it more versatile. This may require changes in the way payment information is structured.
Retry Logic: Adding retries (with a limit) means that temporary failures in communication with the payment gateway will not result in immediate failure. This improves the robustness of the payment processing system.
Error Feedback: The function now returns more detailed error messages in case of failure, making it easier to diagnose problems and provide better customer support.
Payment Gateway Interaction: The system is now dependent on external payment services. If those services are unreliable, it could affect the ability to process payments.
Steps to Implement:

Update the process_payment function to accept multiple payment methods (credit_card, paypal, etc.).
Implement retry logic using a loop to retry failed payment attempts.
Ensure that failure responses from the payment gateway are parsed properly and returned to the user with meaningful messages.
Example of Behavior:

If a user tries to pay using PayPal and the gateway returns an error, the system will retry up to 3 times before informing the user that the payment failed.
If the payment method is unsupported (like a custom payment method), the system will return an error indicating this.
